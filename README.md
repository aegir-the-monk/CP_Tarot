# CP_Tarot
A website for looking up tarot cards and for automated readings.
This is a pet project just made to practice Java and Spring boot. CSS and HTML inspired by my love for cheesy cyberpunk-ish
movies, see HACKERS.

Getting Started:
Compile program, run Application.java, open localhost8080 in your browser.

Used Gradle for dependency management

CSS for retro CRT effect from:
